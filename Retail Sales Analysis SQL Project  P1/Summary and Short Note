My SQL 1st Practice Project Journey

Problems I Faced:

1. After going through many tutorials and websites, I thought I had learned SQL. But when I actually sat down to write    queries, I realized I hardly remembered anything.
2. I didn’t know what to write, where to start, or in what order to do things.
3. Simple things confused me, like where to put ;, what GROUP BY 1,2 actually means, or how to use the ROUND function.    Even though I had notes, when it came to applying them, I went completely blank.
4. I spent a lot of time on formatting—like when to use uppercase or lowercase, how much space to give, how many lines    to leave between queries. It all felt very confusing.
5. On top of all this, I didn’t know how to use the command line properly. I made many mistakes while creating            databases, got errors, and didn’t know how to tackle or resolve them, which left me feeling stuck.

How I Solved Them:
1. I calmed myself down and used the internet for references and help whenever I got stuck.
2. When I got frustrated or angry because things weren’t working, I took short breaks to relax. After that, I came        back and continued working on the project.

Mistakes I Made:
1. Getting angry too quickly.
2. Shutting my laptop down when I got frustrated.
3. Searching for tutorials or solutions immediately instead of trying to think and solve the problem myself.
4. Taking way too much time to complete even a small practice project.
5. I wanted to post this project on GitHub earlier, but I didn’t because I was too tired and frustrated with all the      problems and errors.

Reflection:
I made a lot of mistakes, but this was my first project. After completing it, I felt really happy. It was amazing to     see that I actually created something, practiced a lot, and now have a project I can add to my resume or GitHub.
I faced many challenges—errors, back pain, neck pain, and constant frustration—but I didn’t give up. I faced             everything and finally completed this project. I’m proud of myself for doing it.
I hope to keep improving and learning more in the future. Thank you to myself for the effort, patience, and              persistence!
