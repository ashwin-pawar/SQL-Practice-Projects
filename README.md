# SQL-Practice-Projects
I have completed learning SQL, but I realized my concepts needed more clarity. To strengthen my understanding, I decided to build projects. This approach gives me hands-on practice and boosts my confidence in applying SQL effectively. Instead of passively watching tutorials, I focus on project-based learning to continuously improve my skills.
