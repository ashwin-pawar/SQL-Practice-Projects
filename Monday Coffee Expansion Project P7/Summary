In this project, I solved some real-world problems.
You can refer to the README.md file or my SQL file to know more.

In this project, I solved many SQL problems — some basic, some of medium difficulty, and 3–4 that were hard. I also gained a lot of learnings. I learned about a new SQL function, LAG(), which is a window function used to bring data from the previous row into the current row. I also used CTE, window functions, and subqueries effectively in this project.

For me, the project level was from intermediate to advanced. Step by step, by building such projects, I will continue to refine my skills, strengthen my knowledge, and solve more problems.

Thanks.
